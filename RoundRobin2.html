			<h3><center>What Makes a Good Dictator</center></h3>
			<p><center>Hitler was one of the most successful dictators. This page will explain how he got to where he was. He is a perfect example to becoming a dictator.</center></p>
			<p>Hitler made a good dictator because, he had someone to hate, had powerful speeches, and acted on his beliefs. You need to have someone to hate if you are a dictator so you can prove that you can get rid of them. If you hate them, it is likely other people do too. Hitler also had very powerful speeches. Without his speeches he would not be able to spread his point. You need to act on your beliefs, and spread an idea. You need to act to make something happen. Hitler was one of the best dictators due to these actions.</p>

			<p>Germany, after WWI was the perfect place for a dictatorship to start. Germany was forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles because of WWI. That treaty had many misfortunes for Germany and the citizens hated it. The quote “millions of Germans lost their jobs” explained that the German economy also crashed. The citizens blamed the government and formed political instability. Germany was the perfect place for a dictatorship because, it had political problems, economic problems, and social problems.
				First, the German government had many political problems. The quote, “Angry German workers resisted the French takeover by going on strike.” says that German workers resisted takeover of their mines by going on strike against the French. Germans decided to start riots in hope for a new leader. Germans often blamed the government for their troubles so they want to get rid of it. The current German government has political instability because of the mistrust. The political instability formed when the Germans stopped trusting the government. The political situation was perfect for a dictatorship to start.
				After WWI, Germany had social problems. The people were angry towards the government. The quote, “Hitler appealed to people’s fear about the economy and their bitterness about the Treaty of Versailles.” explained that people were afraid of the Treaty of Versailles. The Germans did not trust the government because they were the ones who signed the treaty. The Germans blamed the government for the treaty. The German government printed money to get Germany out of debt. Because of the money they printed, many Germans were homeless and starving. The social problems in Germany were harsh and hopeless, perfect for a dictator.
				Finally, Germany had economic problems after WWI. The Germans were afraid of the economy and how it will change. “Many Germans, worried about the economy, began to vote for the Nazis.” explained that Germany were afraid of the economy. After wars, most countries are in debt. WWI left many people starving and homeless. The people of Germany were looking for a new hope. They decided to put their hope in Hitler to save them. After WWI, Germany's economy was destroyed.
				WWI left Germany in shambles. The people didn’t trust the government, causing political instability. Germany also had many social problems, causing people to look for a miracle, or a dictator. There was also many economic problems, and Germany’s citizens had little or no money. Germany was destroyed due to the treaty of versailles. If this were to happen again to us, it would be detrimental.

			<h3><center>Propaganda<center></h3>
			<p><center>Propaganda is an essential part to dictatorship. It helps show your image and gets you the hearts and minds of the people. This chapter will show an image of a dictator that I created from the 2016's U.S. by the way, this is not a real propaganda or a real dictator.</center></p>
